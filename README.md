Couple python scripts to communicate with laboratory equipment via GPIB, RS232 and RS232-to-Ethernet adapters

This repo contains three simple poorly-written python scripts that do basic communication with Keithley VC-meter using different means.

Don't forget to make sure proper kernel modules are loaded before losing hope.

Also don't forget about assigning user rights for certain resources such as pseudo-file usbTTY. Or run as root (not recommended)

Have fun!
